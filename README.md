# Face-Detection-ML
Face Detection in Machine Learning using Python (OpenCV and Dlib)

The Face Detection project in Google Colab showcases adept use of OpenCV and Dlib for face detection. The code covers image loading, resizing, and Haar cascades for robust facial detection. It extends to eye, car, clock, and full-body detection, exhibiting versatility. Incorporating advanced techniques like Dlib's HOG detector and CNN-based face detection highlights a progressive approach.

The project stands out through a comparative analysis of performance metrics, refining algorithms for real-world scenarios. Face detection in diverse images emphasizes adaptability. Overall, the project offers a nuanced exploration of face detection algorithms, combining traditional methods with advanced models, underscoring accessibility and collaborative development on Google Colab.
